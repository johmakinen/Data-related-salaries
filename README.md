# Data-related-salaries
The objective is to do EDA on data related job postings (USA). Later we can try to predict a salary using job posting information.

# Why?
When applying for a data related job (Data scientist, Data Analyst...), it can be hard to forget how well some companies can pay for your time. Of course, as a mathematical person, the compensations can be a deciding factor between two otherwise similar jobs.

# TODO:

- [ ] Read the data in and perform EDA.
    We do this to get a clearer picture of the dataset, and if there are any anomalies in it.
- [ ] Create a precttion model that can predict the salary when given information about the job.

- [ ] Dockerize and deploy, so that anyone can use the tool
    The point of the whole tool is to help you understand what different positions are paying, which can then be leveraged in the interviews for your own benefit. Do not let employers lowball you!
